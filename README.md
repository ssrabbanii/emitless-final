Team 112:

Hello, I'm Sakib, and I'm excited to present our innovative solution, EmitLess, developed to enhance the travel experience with a focus on premium and eco-conscious travel. Our team has dedicated the last 24 hours to creating a unique solution that transcends traditional flight and hotel offerings.

Background and Inspiration:

Reflecting on personal travel experiences and market research, we identified a significant gap in the travel industry. Our findings showed that 89% of travelers feel their experience lacks personalization, and 77% are keen to engage in carbon offsetting. With Cathay Pacific's goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, our team recognized an opportunity for innovation, especially for economy travelers seeking a memorable journey.

Introducing EmitLess:

EmitLess is an app designed to provide a personalized platform for travelers to offset their carbon footprint, offering a meaningful and memorable experience. It's more than just an app; it's a commitment to responsible and enjoyable travel.

Key Features and Innovations:

Personalized Carbon Offset:
How It Works: Travelers can offset their carbon footprint by directly contributing to environmental projects. For instance, a flight to Brazil can be counterbalanced by supporting sustainability initiatives in Brazil.
Transparency and Choice: Users select the destination country, view sustainable development goals, and choose where their donations go, ensuring transparency and alignment with their values.

EcoShare:
Social Integration: Recognizing the modern trend of sharing experiences on social media, EcoShare allows users to share their contributions with personalized eco-filters.
Impact Visibility: This feature highlights the specific areas of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) impacted by the user, enhancing the sense of personal contribution and community engagement.

Personalized User Experience for Carbon Credit Donation:
Unique Offering: While Cathay Pacific and other airlines offer carbon offset options, EmitLess elevates this by providing a deeply personalized journey for carbon credit donations.
Competitive Advantage: This unique personalization aspect positions Cathay Pacific to stand out in the market, offering a more engaging and individualized experience for travelers committed to sustainability.

Conclusion:
EmitLess is not just an application; it's a gateway to a new era of travel where personalization and environmental responsibility go hand in hand. By focusing on memorable experiences and personalized carbon offsetting, EmitLess aims to redefine what it means to travel sustainably, aligning with Cathay Pacific's environmental goals and enhancing the overall travel experience for its customers.
